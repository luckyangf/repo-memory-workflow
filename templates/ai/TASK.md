## Objective
- This repo uses `.ai/` as the editor-agnostic source-of-truth for AI work.
- Track active tasks, queued tasks, and completed work here.

## Current state
- `.ai/` workflow initialized.
- No project-specific tasks have been created yet.

## Next actions
- [ ] If this repo already has half-done work: run Retrofit (Task 000)
- [ ] If this is a new requirement: ask AI to split it into 3~10 tasks under `.ai/tasks/`
- [ ] Move tasks between Active / Queued / Done as progress is made
