- There may be no task cards, no log, and no clear current state.

## Acceptance criteria
- `.ai/TASK.md` reflects the real current work
- 3~10 task cards exist under `.ai/tasks/`
- One task is marked as Active and has executable Next actions
- `.ai/LOG.md` contains a short retrofit entry

## Current state
- Unknown / not documented yet

## Next actions
1. Read `.ai/START.md`, `.ai/CONTEXT.md`, `.ai/PROMPT_START.md`
2. Scan the repo quickly (top-level folders + README)
3. Summarize current progress in 5~10 bullets
4. Identify the current primary goal
5. Create 3~10 task cards under `.ai/tasks/`
6. Update `.ai/TASK.md` (Active / Queued / Done)
